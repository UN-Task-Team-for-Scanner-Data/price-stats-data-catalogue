# Adding a new dataset to the catalogue

Thank you for proposing to submit a new dataset to the catalogue. Please describe the dataset and fill in the maturity model template to summarize the record.

## Checklist

-   [ ] I have read the [contribution guide](https://un-task-team-for-scanner-data.github.io/reproducibility-project/docs/catalogue/contributing.html)

-   [ ] I have reviewed the [default tags](https://un-task-team-for-scanner-data.github.io/reproducibility-project/docs/catalogue/about.html#what-are-the-tags-used-in-the-catalogue)

## Dataset overview

**Relates to issue #:**

*Specify NA or add link to issue number if applicable*

**Summarize dataset value to researchers:**

*Specify why this dataset is of value to researches in price statistics*

**If you wish to propose a new tag (or multiple) to categorize this dataset, specify the tags:**

-   *tag 1 - meant for X*

-   *tag 2*  - meant for y

## Maturity level of the dataset

Fill in the following checklist to specify the dataset maturity level.

## Level 1

This level sets a bare minimum a dataset needs to have to be registered to the catalogue

-   [ ] The dataset has a basic description to introduce it to any users in the discipline
-   [ ] The data model (structure of the data and each variable) is documented
-   [ ] The dataset is available openly and the data file format is anything that is machine readable (for instance a proprietary format like `.xlsx` or language specific data formats like `.Rdata` are fine, however a pdf is not) is referenced.
-   [ ] The license (or at minimum terms of the use of the dataset) is listed so that it is clear how the dataset can be used and how it cannot.
-   [ ] Information on how to cite the dataset is available.

## Level 2

Level 2 implies a higher level of maturity to simplify the process for data

-   [ ] The dataset is stored in an open file format
-   [ ] Dataset quality considerations and detailed nuances of the data are discussed. This is best done in specific quality section of each variable or for the table/dataset as a whole.

## Level 3

This implies a 'gold standard' for a dataset

-   [ ] The dataset is made available in a data repository (such as Zenodo) that mints a DOI. This DOI is listed as part of the dataset.
-   [ ] A data paper detailing the dataset is available and linked. Alternatively, a blog can also be written on the project site to introduce the dataset with the dataset owner.
