  title: Modified Electronics NZ dataset
  version: '1.0'
  description: |
    A modified dataset that was based on real scanner data obtained from GfK. The dataset contains sales (both quanitity and total sales) by month for 459 unique products in a single consumer electronic category for a total of 26 months (2017-01-01 to 2019-02-01). The dataset includes 11 different quality chacacteristics (all are obfuscated to hide their true values). Distribution of quality characteristis and their relationships to quality adjustment was maintained during the modification process.<br>
    <br>
    Dataset facilitates evaluation of quality adjustment methods with scanner data.
